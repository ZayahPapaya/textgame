  <h1>A Brief Summary of Me</h1>
  <main>
    <!-- TODO Make this into a UL  V -->
    <p>
      My legal name is Aiden Lang; but as you might've encountered so far in the class, my preferred name is Zayah! My
      pronouns are she/her but I understand that it is difficult to remember and use due to my voice. I cannot properly
      transition at this time, and this career is meant to be my ticket to do so. Additionally, my family is not
      particularly supportive of the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took two years of public high school at Snohomish High, a fantastic school determined to have quality students,
      but pulled out to instead finish high school via homeschooling. I do wish I hadn't, and would not recommend
      homeschooling for most others. I do not plan to go to college, but I do plan on devoting to software development
      and these trade school-like classes.
    </p>

      My first job was at a local arcade and game store, Let's Play Arcade, as a general extra hand. I had no particular
      role, and instead was set to do whatever was needed. I learned to take apart those arcade machines, which are
      absolute death traps mind you, and maintain them. I learned popular tabletop games: Magic: the Gathering,
      Warhammer 40k, Dungeons and Dragons, and a touch of Pokemon. A large part of my job there was to actively
      encourage people to spend much more money than they'd meant to when they walked through the doors. After all,
      everyone needs more dice.
      My favorite D&D classes are: Artificer, Monk, Warlock, and Rogue
    </p>
    <p>
      The second job I took was at Starbucks as a barista, which has been a much better work environment but is also a
      shockingly demanding job. There is rarely a quiet moment, and everything must be done quickly and efficiently
      while also being a pleasant host for the environment Starbucks tries to maintain. Free coffee and lunch, however,
      helped keep me going.

      My goals at the moment are simple: Learn quickly, get a grip on my career, and become properly independant.

    Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have. 

    Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.
  
    Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (don’t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project.

    Ask the user their name through a prompt()

    Display that name back to the user through a custom greeting welcoming them to your site.

    Display the user’s name back to them in your final message to the user.
